In this set of experiments, we are testing how organizing the data in terms of difficulty.

The first step is to train a model on HotPotQA, a dataset that has 3 types of difficulties (easy, medium, hard).
* This will provide a baseline to demonstrate that training from easy to hard actually works

The second step is to find ways of approximating the difficulty of a prompt.
* There's many ways to do this

The third step is to see how a smaller model's understanding of difficulty translates to the perceived difficulty of a larger model.
* You can model
