This experiment is for loss smoothing experiments, where we vary the loss smoothing coefficient (alpha) from [0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2], as detailed in our paper.

Run the `cs182_proj_python.py`. This will output all the files into the relevant folder defined as RESULTS_DIR: ("out"). Run it simply with `python cs182_proj_python.py`.

Make sure to setup the conda environment. Ensure running in the virtual environment "llm" after running the `setup.sh`
