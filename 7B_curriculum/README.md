This experiment is for running the 7B curriculum experiment. We divide training into Phase 1 and Phase 2. Here we train on A MIXTURE of MATH dataset and the HotPotQA dataset for both phases. In the first phase, we mix MATH with HotPotQA at a ratio of 80/20. Then for the second phase, we mix the datasets with ratio 20/80. Finally, we measure the loss as we are training the second phase on both HotPotQA and MATH. We hope to see that catastrophic forgetting has been mitigated relative to baseline experiment. 

Run the `curriculum_file.py`. This will output all the files into the relevant folder defined as RESULTS_DIR: ("out"). Run it simply with `python curriculum_file.py`.
